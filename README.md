## OK, Let's start :smiley:

Your client has just called you and asked you to improve their [company website](https://piotrberebecki.github.io/git-workflow-workshop-for-two/).

There are two issues that when resolved will make their site super cool:

1. Spelling mistake in heading.
1. The css styles do not seem to be working.

You decide that one of you (Programmer 1) will resolve issue number 1 while the other person (Programmer 2) will resolve issue number 2.

## Step 1 - Programmer 1 forks this repository

1. Programmer 1 [forks](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository.
