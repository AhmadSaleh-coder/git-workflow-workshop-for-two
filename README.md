# Git Workflow Workshop for Two Programmers ðŸ’» ðŸ’»



<!-- ***********************************************************-->
## Workshop summary

An exercise to practice git workflow skills. The workshop should be undertaken by two programmers, working on two computers. The skills practiced include:

- cloning a repository
- creating branches
- switching branches
- adding changes to staging area
- committing changes
- pulling latest version from the remote master branch
- merging master branch into recently created branch
- resolving merge conflicts
- pushing to remote repository
- creating a pull request on GitHub
- merging a pull request on GitHub



<!-- ***********************************************************-->
# Initial setup :rocket:

You're working in a team of two on a project for a new client.

## Step 1 - Create a new GitHub repo and clone it

1. Go to your cohort's GitHub organiation and create a new repo, initialising it with a `README.md`.

2. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) this new repository using your terminal.

  <img src="images/clone-repository-dialog.png" width="500" height="auto" alt="clone repository dialog">

  ```sh
  $ git clone 'PASTE THE URL OF YOUR REPOSITORY HERE'
  ```

3. Move into the newly created directory.

  ```sh
  $ cd git-workflow-workshop-for-two
  ```



  <!-- ***********************************************************-->
## Step 2 - Raise your issues on the work to be done

Normally, you would decide on which "features" you were going to build and then break these down into smaller issues before starting the work.

For the sake of this exercise, we're just going to add one issue at the moment. Your client wants a beautifully styled heading for the homepage. It should be simple, bold, black writing with a background shadow that makes it stand out.

1. Raise an new issue with a descriptive title.

2. In the body of the issue, provide more detail about how to complete the work.

3. Assign yourselves to this issue.



<!-- ***********************************************************-->
## Step 3 - Create and move to a new branch

There are many types of workflow. At FAC, we use [the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), where the `master` branch is always be deployable. In this flow, each branch is used for a separate feature.

1. Create a branch with a unique and descriptive name. For example, `create-heading-with-shadow`.

```sh
$ git branch create-heading-with-shadow
```

2. Leave the master branch by switching to the new branch you have just created.

```sh
$ git checkout create-heading-with-shadow
```

<!-- ***********************************************************-->
## Step 4 - Write enough HTML & CSS to satisfy the requirements

1. Add the following code into a file called `index.html`.
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
        <title>Git Workflow Workshop</title>
    </head>

    <body>

        <h1 class="some-heading">GIT WORKFLOW WORKSHOW</h1>

    </body>

    </html>
    ```

2. Create a new file called `style.css` which contains:
    ```css
    * {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
    }

    .page-heading {
      box-sizing: border-box;
      font-family: "Avant Garde", Avantgarde, "Century Gothic", CenturyGothic, "AppleGothic", sans-serif;
      font-size: 3.5rem;
      padding: 5rem 3rem;
      text-align: center;
      text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;
      color: #131313;
      background-color: #e7e5e4;
      letter-spacing: .15em;
      text-shadow: 1px -1px 0 #767676, -1px 2px 1px #737272, -2px 4px 1px #767474, -3px 6px 1px #787777, -4px 8px 1px #7b7a7a, -5px 10px 1px #7f7d7d, -6px 12px 1px #828181, -7px 14px 1px #868585, -8px 16px 1px #8b8a89, -9px 18px 1px #8f8e8d, -10px 20px 1px #949392, -11px 22px 1px #999897, -12px 24px 1px #9e9c9c, -13px 26px 1px #a3a1a1, -14px 28px 1px #a8a6a6, -15px 30px 1px #adabab, -16px 32px 1px #b2b1b0, -17px 34px 1px #b7b6b5, -18px 36px 1px #bcbbba, -19px 38px 1px #c1bfbf, -20px 40px 1px #c6c4c4, -21px 42px 1px #cbc9c8, -22px 44px 1px #cfcdcd, -23px 46px 1px #d4d2d1, -24px 48px 1px #d8d6d5, -25px 50px 1px #dbdad9, -26px 52px 1px #dfdddc, -27px 54px 1px #e2e0df, -28px 56px 1px #e4e3e2;
    }
    ```


<!-- ***********************************************************-->
## Step 5 - Add the new files to the staging area

1. Add `index.html` and `style.css` to the [staging area](http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/119782/what-does-stage-mean-in-git).

  ```sh
  $ git add index.html style.css
  ```


<!-- ***********************************************************-->
## Step 6 - Commit your changes

The history of a project is made up of ["commits"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27ËœÎ©45076/what-are-the-differences-between-git-commit-and-git-push). Each commit is a snapshot of your whole repository at one particular time.

1. Commit the files that are in the staging area.

  Before closing the commit message with a quote symbol you can press enter on your keyboard to continue typing in the new terminal line. The text in the second line can be used as an additional message.

  It is a good practice to link your commit to an existing issue by typing  `Relates #1`. Thanks to using the hash symbol followed by the relevant issue number your commit will be [automatically linked to an existing issue](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/).

  ```sh
  $ git commit -m 'add git workshop heading & shadow styling
  > Relates #1'
  ```


<!-- ***********************************************************-->
## Step 7 - Push your local version up to GitHub

1. [Push](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/) the `create-heading-with-shadow` branch up to the "origin" i.e. the GitHub repo that you cloned from.

  ```sh
  $ git push origin create-heading-with-shadow
  ```


<!-- ***********************************************************-->
# Splitting the work
Your client has just called you and asked to improve heading on their [company website](https://piotrberebecki.github.io/git-workflow-workshop-for-two/).

There are two issues that when resolved will make the heading look really nice:

1. Spelling mistake in the heading (the word 'WORKSHOW' should be replaced with 'WORKSHOP')
1. The name of the css class in the heading needs to be updated so that existing styles in the `style.css` file can take effect (`class="some-heading"` should be replaced with `class="page-heading"`).

Current heading:

<img src="images/heading-before.png" width="500" height="auto" alt="git workflow workshop heading without css style">

When you apply the two changes above the heading will look like this:

<img src="images/heading-after.png" width="500" height="auto" alt="git workflow workshop heading with css style">


You decide that one of you **(Programmer 1) will resolve issue number 1** while the other person **(Programmer 2) will resolve issue number 2**. When you begin working on your weekly projects, you will always be pairing. So programmer 1 represents "pair 1" and programmer 2 represents "pair 2".

**Note: Only one line in the `index.html` file needs to be modified.**


<!-- ***********************************************************-->
## Step 4 - Both programmers create one branch each and switch to them

1. Both programmers create one [branch](https://help.github.com/articles/about-branches/) each. Unique and descriptive branch names work best, for example, `fix-typo-heading` (Programmer 1) and `update-class-heading` (Programmer 2).

  ```sh
  # Programmer 1:
  $ git branch fix-typo-heading

  # Programmer 2:
  $ git branch update-class-heading
  ```

1. Both programmers leave the master branch by switching to the new branches.

  ```sh
  # Programmer 1:
  $ git checkout fix-typo-heading

  # Programmer 2:
  $ git checkout update-class-heading
  ```



<!-- ***********************************************************-->
## Step 5 - Both programmers open their `index.html` files and make one requested change each

1. **Programmer 1 fixes only the spelling typo** in the heading (WORKSHOW -> WORKSHOP). Please do not update the class name. This is dealt with by Programmer 2.

  ```html
  <h1 class="some-heading">GIT WORKFLOW WORKSHOP</h1>
  ```

1. **Programmer 2 updates only the class name** of the heading (`class="some-heading"` -> `class="page-heading"`). Please do not fix the spelling mistake. This is dealt with by Programmer 1.

  ```html
  <h1 class="page-heading">GIT WORKFLOW WORKSHOW</h1>
  ```



<!-- ***********************************************************-->
## Step 6 - Both programmers save their `index.html` files and check status

1. Both programmers save their `index.html` files and check the [status](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status) to confirm that the file has been modified.

  ```sh
  $ git status
  ```



<!-- ***********************************************************-->
## Step 7 - Both programmers add the modified `index.html` file to the staging area

1. Both programmers add their modified `index.html` files to the [staging area](http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/119782/what-does-stage-mean-in-git).

  ```sh
  $ git add index.html
  ```



<!-- ***********************************************************-->
## Step 8 - Both programmers commit their changes

1. Both programmers [commit](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27ËœÎ©45076/what-are-the-differences-between-git-commit-and-git-push) the changes. Before closing the commit message with a quote symbol you can press enter on your keyboard to continue typing in the new terminal line. The text in the second line can be used as an additional message. It is a good practice to link your commit to an existing issue by typing  `Relates #1`. Thanks to using the hash symbol followed by the relevant issue number your commit will be [automatically linked to an existing issue](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/).

  ```sh
  # Programmer 1:
  $ git commit -m 'Fix typo in page heading
  > Relates #1'

  # Programmer 2:
  $ git commit -m 'Update class name in heading
  > Relates #2'
  ```



<!-- ***********************************************************-->
## Step 9 - Programmer 1 switches to `master` branch and pulls remote `master` branch

1. Programmer 1 switches to `master` branch.

  ```sh
  $ git checkout master
  ```

1. Programmer 1 [pulls](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull) the remote `master` branch to make sure that the latest version of the project is available locally. There should be no changes since none of you have pushed any changes to the remote yet. It is a good practice to regularly check for changes on the remote before pushing your local changes.

  ```sh
  $ git pull origin master
  ```

1. Programmer 1 switches back to the `fix-typo-heading` branch.

  ```sh
  $ git checkout fix-typo-heading
  ```



<!-- ***********************************************************-->
## Step 10 - Programmer 1 pushes `fix-typo-heading` branch to remote

1. Programmer 1 [pushes](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/) `fix-typo-heading` branch to remote

  ```sh
  $ git push origin fix-typo-heading
  ```



<!-- ***********************************************************-->
## Step 11 - Programmer 1 creates a pull request

1. Programmer 1 navigates to the repository on GitHub.com and creates a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/#creating-the-pull-request) selecting `master` as a base branch and `fix-typo-heading` as a head branch. Please add a descriptive title (e.g. `Fix the spelling mistake in page heading`) and leave a comment linking the pull request with the issue `#1`. Please also select Programmer 2 as an [assignee](https://help.github.com/articles/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users/).

  <img src="images/pull-request-open.png" width="500" height="auto" alt="open pull request page">



<!-- ***********************************************************-->
## Step 12 - Programmer 2 merges the pull request :+1:

1. Programmer 2 reviews and [merges the pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-a-pull-request/#merging-a-pull-request-on-github) on GitHub.com.

  <img src="images/pull-request-tab.png" width="500" height="auto" alt="pull request tab button">

2. Programmer 2 opens the live website on GitHub pages to double check that the spelling mistake has been corrected. The URL typically has the following format: https://ENTER-YOUR-USERNAME-HERE.github.io/git-workflow-workshop-for-two/



<!-- ***********************************************************-->
## Step 13 - Programmer 2 switches to `master` branch, pulls the remote `master` branch, tries to merge it into `update-class-heading` branch and :collision: resolves merge conflicts :collision:

1. Programmer 2 switches to `master` branch.

  ```sh
  $ git checkout master
  ```

1. Programmer 2 [pulls](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull) the remote `master` branch to make sure that the latest version of the project is available locally.

  ```sh
  $ git pull origin master
  ```

1. Programmer 2 switches back to the `update-class-heading` branch.

  ```sh
  $ git checkout update-class-heading
  ```

1. Programmer 2 tries to merge `master` branch into `update-class-heading` branch.

  ```sh
  $ git merge master
  ```

1. There should be a :collision: merge conflict :collision: since the line with the `<h1>` heading is different. [Merge conflict should be highlighted with HEAD and master markers](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7901864/git-conflict-markers) as follows:

  ```html
  <body>

  <<<<<<< HEAD
      <h1 class="page-heading">GIT WORKFLOW WORKSHOW</h1>
  =======
      <h1 class="some-heading">GIT WORKFLOW WORKSHOP</h1>
  >>>>>>> master

  </body>
  ```

1. Programmer 1 removes HEAD and master markers and leaves only one line with `<h1>` heading so that both issues are addressed.

  ```html
  <body>

      <h1 class="page-heading">GIT WORKFLOW WORKSHOP</h1>

  </body>
  ```

1. Programmer 1 adds the `index.html` file to staging area and commits the changes occurred during the merge conflict.

  ```sh
  # First add to staging area
  $ git add index.html

  # Then commit changes
  $ git commit -m 'Fix merge conflict
  > Relates #1 and #2'
  ```



<!-- ***********************************************************-->
## Step 15 - Programmer 2 pushes `update-class-heading` branch to remote

1. Programmer 2 [pushes](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/) `update-class-heading` branch to remote.

  ```sh
    $ git push origin update-class-heading
  ```



<!-- ***********************************************************-->
## Step 16 - Programmer 2 creates a pull request

1. Programmer 2 navigates to the repository on GitHub.com and creates a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/#creating-the-pull-request) selecting `master` as a base branch and `update-class-heading` as a head branch. Please add a descriptive title (e.g. `Update class name in page heading`) and leave a comment linking the pull request with the issue `#2`. Please also select Programmer 1 as an [assignee](https://help.github.com/articles/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users/).



<!-- ***********************************************************-->
## Step 17 - Programmer 1 merges the pull request :+1:

1. Programmer 1 reviews and [merges the pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-a-pull-request/#merging-a-pull-request-on-github) on GitHub.com.

2. Programmer 1 opens the live website on GitHub pages to double check the new heading style.
